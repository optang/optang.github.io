Urn model
======
In statistics, an urn model is an idealized way of modeling real-life problems as if they were problems which involve drawing balls out of an urn, or box.

The urn contains balls of two or more colors. Depending on the problem being studied, the balls may be:

* Replaced after each draw (called sampling with replacement),
* Not replaced after each draw (called sampling without replacement),
* Added depending on the outcome of the draw. For example, if you draw a green ball, you might add another green ball to the urn. This is called a Pólya Urn.
